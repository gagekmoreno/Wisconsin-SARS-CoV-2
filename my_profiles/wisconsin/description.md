## Overview 
This build serves to represent all sequences that our lab has generated, as well as sequences from around the state of Wisconsin. 

This build directory contains 5 unique builds:

* ncov/wisconsin/global-context
    
    This build serves to represent all WI sequences and to pull in sequences from around the globe to contextualize our findings. 
* ncov/wisconsin/statewide

    This build serves to represent all WI sequences on their own so we can see the relationship between counties.
* ncov/wisconsin/dane-county

    This build serves to represent all Dane County sequences - where the University of Wisconsin - Madison is located. The vast majority of sequences that we generate are from Dane County. 
* ncov/wisconsin/milwaukee-county

    This build serves to represent all Milwaukee County sequences. This county is the largest and most populous in Wiscosin. 
* ncov/wisconsin/avrl

    This build serves to represent only the sequences that we have generated at AVRL.
